**AIM** (Adsorption Inetrgated Modules) is a collection of MATLAB based GUI modules for adsorption isotherm based fixed bed process modelling. 
**AIM** modules provide an integrated workflow for adsorption isotherm fitting at single and multiple temperatures, isosteric heat of adsorption estimation, mixture adsorption isotherm
predcition, and multicomponent fixed bed breakthrough simulation.

Primary featues of AIM include:

* Integrated workflow within modules
* GUI environemnet to facilaitate data input/output, model seelction, and simulation type selection
* Dynamic plots for pressure, loading, temperature, and composition
* Data and graphics export in different formats

AIM software and the associated source code are opensource and freely avaibale at our GitHub repository `AIM Repository <https://github.com/mtap-research/AIM>`_.
